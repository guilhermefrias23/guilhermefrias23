Hi all! Great to meet you ðŸ˜„

I'm Guilherme and I'm 25 years old. I've graduated by the **Universty of Coimbra**, where I was first introduced to prgramming languages, mainly Python and R. Worked as an Research Intern in Investment Analysis and Prediction via _machine learning_ algorithms.
In 2020 concluded my **MSc in Management of Services and Technology** and will soon attend the Post-Graduation classes of **Enterprise Data Science and Analytics**.

Currently I know how to code in **Python**, **R** and **VBA** (mostly VBA for the last year)

Please feel free to reach my via my linkedIn profile page.
