### Hi all! Great to meet you ðŸ˜„

##### I'm Guilherme and I'm 26 years old. I'm graduated by the ***Universty of Coimbra*** and in 2020 concluded my ***MSc in Management of Services and Technology***.
As of now I'm attending the Post-Graduation classes of ***Enterprise Data Science and Analytics*** and developing some new projects based on these newly acquired knowledge and tools.

##### Currently I code in ***Python***, ***Spark***, ***R*** and ***VBA***.

##### During the past months I've learned how to program in ***SQL*** and how to manage Relational and Non-Relational Databases, hoping to add some projects regarding these subjects on here soon.

#### I've been developing some projects on the Post-Graduation program using Clustering and Supervised algorithms for classification purposes that will be posted here as soon as they are concluded


##### Please take a look at some of the projects that I've placed below and feel free to reach my via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhermepdfrias/) profile page.
